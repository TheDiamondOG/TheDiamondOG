# TheDiamondOG Github Page

This is a place where I put all of my random projects that I want to release.\
Don't expect me to do some big project that is always useful for you.\
This is just to get cool projects out no mater if it's big or small.

# My Favorite Projects
- Terminal Binary Script
  - The point of this is make it look like your a hollywood hacker. This is more of a party trick than anything.
  - Project: https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/Hacker-Binary-Script
- Minecraft Server Tracker
  - This was inspired by Gorilla Tag self trackers but for minecraft. This only works for 1.20.4 though.
  - Project: https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/MinecraftServerTracker/tree/main
