# TheDiamondOG Github Page

This is a place where I put all of my random projects that I want to release.\
Don't expect me to do some big project that is always useful for you.\
This is just to get cool projects out no mater if it's big or small.

# My Favorite Projects
- Dia Muck Mods
  - This is a bit bias since this was the first ever mod/mod menu I have ever made.
  - Project: https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/DiaMuckMods
- Dia Supermarket Together Mods
  - This is a menu with more than 7 months in the making, and this is one of the most over powered menus I have ever made. I recommened it if you play this game.
  - Project: https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/DiaSupermarketTogetherMenu
- Terminal Binary Script
  - The point of this is make it look like your a hollywood hacker. This is more of a party trick than anything.
